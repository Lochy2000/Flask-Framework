                The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in
                Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family
                inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
                Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous
                Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their
                company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
                Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes
                prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also
                considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
                leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.
